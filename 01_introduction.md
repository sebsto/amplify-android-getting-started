# Introduction

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will create a simple Android application using AWS Amplify, a set of tools and serverless services in the cloud. In the first module, you‚Äôll build a simple Android application. Through the remaining modules, you will initialize a local app using the Amplify Command Line Interface (Amplify CLI), add user authentication, add a GraphQL API and a database to store your data, and update your app to store images.

## What you Will Learn

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to create a simple Android application discussed above. You will learn to:

- Manage serverless cloud backend from the command line

- Add auth to your app to enable sign-in and sign-out

- Add a GraphQL API, database, and storage solution

- Share your backend between multiple projects

## Modules

This tutorial is divided into five short modules. You must complete each module in order, before moving on to the next one.

- [Create an Android App](02_create_android_app.md) (10 minutes): Create an Android app and test it in the Android simulator.

- [Initialize a Local App](03_initialize_amplify.md) (10 minutes): Initialize a local app using AWS Amplify.

- [Add Authentication](04_add_authentication.md) (10 minutes): Add auth to your application.

- [Add a GraphQL API and Database](05_add_api_database.md) (20 minutes): Create a GraphQL API.

- [Add the Ability to Store Images](06_add_storage.md) (10 minutes): Add storage to your app.

You will be building this Android application using the [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) and Google's [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) IDE.

## Tutorial pre-requisites

This tutorial has been developed and tested on macOS but should work also on Windows and Linux.

To follow this tutorial, you need the following tools and resources:

- [Android Studio 4.x](https://developer.android.com/studio) or more recent.
- an [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) with at least [these permissions](/amplify-policy.json) (an `Administrator` role or `root` account will also work, but we recommend a [least-privileges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) approach).
- [NodeJS 10.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or more recent.
- AWS Command Line Interface [AWS CLI 2.0.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) or more recent.

On Linux and Mac, you can install these tools following these instructions:

```zsh
